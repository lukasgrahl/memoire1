#### Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium: An empirical application to petrol prices and inflation
This work retraces the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Literature from its roots in Real Business Cycles theory, through the standard New-Keynesian model to an extension by exogenous petrol prices. In doing so it aims at investigating the theorised link between inflation and petrol prices by drawing from Bayesian estimation of structural models. 
Following an outline of the modelling mechanism, model parameters are calibrated using the Kalman filter and Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Evaluating the calibrated models in their data fit as well as forecasting properties beyond a Vector Autoregression allows for two main conclusion. 
The modelling procedure is capable of producing forecasts beyond such Vector Autoregression. Yet, an extension of the New-Keynesian framework by petrol prices does not provide further forecasting power.
