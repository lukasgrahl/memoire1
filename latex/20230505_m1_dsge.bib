	abstract = {I study optimal monetary policy in a simple New Keynesian model with portfolio adjustment costs. Purchases of long-term debt by the central bank (quantitative easing; ‘QE’) alter the average portfolio return and hence influence aggregate demand and inflation. The central bank chooses the short-term policy rate and QE to minimise a welfare-based loss function under discretion. Adoption of QE is rapid, with large-scale asset purchases triggered when the policy rate hits the zero bound, consistent with observed policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis. Optimal exit is gradual. Despite the presence of portfolio adjustment costs, a policy of ‘permanent QE’ in which the central bank holds a constant stock of long-term bonds does not improve welfare.},

	abstract = {The effects of asset purchase programs on macroeconomic variables are likely to be moderate. We reach this conclusion after simulating the impact of the Federal Reserve’s second large-scale asset purchase program (LSAP II) in a DSGE model enriched with a preferred habitat framework and estimated on U.S. data. Our simulations suggest that such a program increases GDP growth by less than half a percentage point, although the effect on the level of GDP is very persistent. The program’s marginal contribution to inﬂation is very small. One key reason for our ﬁndings is that we estimate a small degree of ﬁnancial market segmentation. If we enrich the set of observables with a measure of long-term debt, the semi-elasticity of the risk premium to the amount of debt in privatesector hands is substantially smaller than that reported in the recent empirical literature. In this case, our baseline estimates of the effects of LSAP II on the macroeconomy decrease by at least a factor of two. Throughout the analysis, a commitment to an extended period at the zero lower bound for nominal interest rates increases the effects of asset purchase programs on GDP growth and inﬂation.},

The model includes two groups of households: (i) wealthier households, who own financial assets and are able to smooth consumption over time, and (ii) poorer households, who only receive labor and transfer income and live ‘hand to mouth’. We use the model to compare the impact of policy shocks on constructed measures of income and wealth inequality (net disposable income, net asset position, and relative per-capita income). Except for the short term, expansionary conventional policy and QE shocks tend to mitigate income and wealth inequality between the two population groups. In light of the coarse dichotomy of households that abstracts from richer income and wealth dynamics at the individual level, the analysis emphasizes the functional distribution of income.},

It takes a pragmatic approach of adapting the workhorse model of a policy institution to COVID-19 data. ‘Forced savings’ are central to explain quarterly real GDP growth during the pandemic, complemented by contributions from foreign demand and trade, and the negative impact of persistently higher savings after the first wave. We provide extensive model validation, including a comparison to off-model evidence for COVID-related restrictions, and a comparison of different model specifications.},

To answer this question, we estimate a large-scale DSGE model over the sample from 1998 until 2020, including data of the Fed’s balance sheet. We allow for QE to aﬀect the economy via multiple channels that arise from several ﬁnancial frictions. Our nonlinear Bayesian likelihood approach fully accounts for the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. We ﬁnd that QE increased output by about 1.2 percent, reﬂecting a net increase in investment of nearly 9 percent accompanied by a 0.7 percent drop in aggregate consumption. Both government bond and capital asset purchases eﬀectively improved ﬁnancing conditions. Especially capital asset purchases signiﬁcantly facilitated new investment and increased the production capacity. Against the backdrop of a fall in consumption, supply side eﬀects dominated, leading to a disinﬂationary eﬀect of about 0.25 percent annually.},

A central challenge facing policymakers is how to assess the relative strength of those forces. Economists have a range of tools that can be used to make such assessments. Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are the leading tool for making such assessments in an open and transparent manner. We review the state of mainstream DSGE models before the financial crisis and the Great Recession. We then describe how DSGE models are estimated and evaluated. We address the question of why DSGE modelers—like most other economists and policymakers—failed to predict the financial crisis and the Great Recession, and how DSGE modelers responded to the financial crisis and its aftermath. We discuss how current DSGE models are actually used by policymakers. We then provide a brief response to some criticisms of DSGE models, with special emphasis on criticism by Joseph Stiglitz, and offer some concluding remarks.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the performance of individual and combination forecasts produced by Bayesian vector autoregressions (Bayesian VARs) with economic and/or non-economic information. In particular, we conduct an out-of-sample forecasting experiment using Bayesian VARs with statistical and/or DSGE prior(s) over two subsamples, representing the so-called “Great Inflation” and “Great Moderation” periods, respectively. Our main findings are summarized as follows. First, in most cases, the inclusion of prior information, either statistical or economic prior(s), improves the accuracy of point forecasts produced by the Bayesian VARs, relative to the ARMA(1,1) benchmark. Second, forecast combination helps to produce unbiased forecasts in most cases. Moreover, it significantly improves the forecast accuracy of the macro-econometric models, especially during the “Great Moderation” period. Third, the selection of the weighting scheme in forecast combination, simple averaging or Bayesian model averaging (BMA), does not affect the conclusions made above. Finally, partially in line with the recent literature, we find a positive relationship between the persistence of inflation and its relative forecast accuracy at the four-quarter horizon.},

The model is applied on ﬁltered data from 1981:Q1 to 2013:Q1 and evaluated by the indirect inference testing. In analysing the structural shocks, the study found higher volatility in energy prices shock during the Great Recession compared to the sample period. The high volatility of energy prices shock caused inﬂationary pressures in the economy. The study found energy prices shock ampliﬁed the Great Recession by signiﬁcantly contributing to the fall in output. Thus, energy prices shock is an important driver of economic activity. However, given the shocks are stationary, energy prices shock is temporary. Therefore, all consequences of energy prices in the economy are short-term. By implication, when volatile energy prices create an output shortfall, monetary policy is the tool used to off-set short-term falls in output. We ﬁnd results persists with robustness check. The ﬁndings justiﬁed why the DSGE model is a policymakers’ workhorse.},

In the 2000s, and at least until the end of 2007, even larger increases in the price of oil were associated with much milder movements in output and inflation. Using a structural VAR approach Blanchard and Gali (2007a) argued that this has reflected in large part a change in the causal relation from the price of oil to output and inflation. In order to shed light on the possible factors behind the decrease in the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks, we develop a new-Keynesian model, with imported oil used both in production and consumption, and we use a minimum distance estimator that minimizes, over the set of structural parameters and for each of the two samples (pre and post 1984), the distance between the empirical SVAR-based impulse response functions and those implied by the model. Our results point to two relevant changes in the structure of the economy, which have modified the transmission mechanism of the oil shock: vanishing wage indexation and an improvement in the credibility of monetary policy. The relative importance of these two structural changes depends however on how we formalize the process of expectations formation by economic agents.},

The main complication is that there are three consumption goods: non-energy output, petrol and utilities; given relative prices and their overall wealth, consumers choose how much of each of these goods to consume in order to maximise their utility. Each of the consumption goods is produced according to a sector-specific production function and sticky prices in each sector imply sector-specific New Keynesian Phillips Curves. I show how this model, once estimated, could form a useful additional input within a policymaker’s ‘suite of models’ by considering its implications for the responses of various macroeconomic variables to different economic shocks and by decomposing recent movements of energy and non-energy output and inflation into the proportions caused by each of the shocks.},

These exercises typically involve augmenting a stochastically singular model with a number of shocks to structural equations to make estimation feasible, even though the motivation for the choice of these shocks is often unspecified. In an attempt to put this approach on a more formal basis, we estimate the model in two stages. First, we evaluate a calibrated version of the stochastically singular model. Then, we augment the model with structural shocks motivated by the results of the evaluation stage and estimate the resulting model using UK data using a Bayesian approach. Finally, we reassess the adequacy of this augmented and estimated model in reconciling the dynamics of the model with the data. Our findings suggest that the shock processes play a crucial role in helping to match the data.},

It complements the results of Baxter and King (1999) with an analytical analysis, demonstrating that the ﬁlter parameter should be adjusted by multiplying it with the fourth power of the observation frequency ratios. This yields an HP parameter value of 6.25 for annual data given a value of 1600 for quarterly data. The relevance of the suggestion is illustrated empirically.},

Additionally, the paper introduces nominal wage and price rigidities through a Calvo setting. Finally, using Bayesian methods, the model is estimated on quarterly U.S. data over the period 1984:Q1-2007:Q3 and then analyzed. The estimation of oil's elasticity of substitution are 0.14 in production and 0.51 in consumption. Moreover, thanks to the low substitutability of oil, the model recovers and explains four well-known stylized facts after the oil price shock in the 2000's: the absent of recession, coupled with a low persistent increase in inflation rate, a decrease in real wages and a low price elasticity of oil demand in the short run. Furthermore, ceteris paribus, the reduction of nominal wage rigidity amplifies the increase in inflation and the decrease in consumption. Thus in this model more wage flexibility does not seem to attenuate the impact of an oil shock.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks and the oil shock transmission mechanism in an oil-exporting country, Canada. We use a structural VAR with sign restrictions that comes from a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to jointly identify oil price, domestic supply and U.S. and domestic monetary policy shocks. This identification strategy not only controls for reverse causality from the Canadian and U.S. macroeconomic conditions to the real oil prices, but more importantly, it also allows for contemporaneous interactions between the Canadian and U.S. variables. We find that oil shocks have a stimulative effect on Canadian aggregate demand, appreciate the Canadian dollar, improve the terms of trade and reduce real wages. Foreign disturbances, including innovations in oil prices and the U.S. interest rate, have a significant influence on Canadian economic activities. Our counterfactual analysis indicates that the reaction of the U.S. interest rate as an indirect transmission channel for oil price shocks plays a moderate role in explaining the real exchange rate and inflation, but has negligible impacts on the Canadian output and interest rate.},

In recent years it has become possible to estimate such models using Bayesian methods.  These exercises typically involve augmenting a stochastically singular model with a number of shocks to structural equations to make estimation feasible, even though the motivation for the choice of these shocks is often unspecified.  In an attempt to put this approach on a more formal basis, we estimate the model in two stages.  First, we evaluate a calibrated version of the stochastically singular model.  Then, we augment the model with structural shocks motivated by the results of the evaluation stage and estimate the resulting model using UK data using a Bayesian approach.  Finally, we reassess the adequacy of this augmented and estimated model in reconciling the dynamics of the model with the data.  Our findings suggest that the shock processes play a crucial role in helping to match the data.},
